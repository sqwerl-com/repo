### Sqwerl Public Catalog

This project contains catalog data for a Sqwerl information store.

Sqwerl is a web application for capturing, managing, and sharing the things that make you smart. 

Sqwerl stores information as Git repositories, called libraries. Sqwerl's libraries can be linked together in
parent-child relationships. If Sqwerl doesn't find a thing within a library, it then searches that library's
parent library and on up the chain. This catalog library acts as a parent library that contains security and
metadata (data about data) that are shared by multiple child libraries.
